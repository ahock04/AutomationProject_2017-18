# AutomationProject_2017-18
This repository will hold examples of ways we can use our skills with PyAutoGui, webbrowser, and time modules to make different kinds of automation

Right now there are three examples of automation in this folder. None of them are complete, and all use similar methods of automating tasks. How can we build upon these to make a better experience for the user and help more people get more things done?
